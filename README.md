## Projects

### [TP1](tp1/README.md)

#### Project information

- **Exploration of different types of textures**. Namely, simple textures, video textures and normal maps.
- **Exploration of different types of materials**. For instance, metalic materials for the chair and table support, a wood material for the table top, ceil and floor, a red cloath material for the chair, a clay material for the jar and a glass translucide material for the window.
- **Exploration of different types of lights and shadows**. Namely, spotlights, point lights and directional lights. With lights entering the room from the windows, giving more realism for the scen and shadows being casted in the scene.
- **Exploration of different types of cameras**. Namely, perspective cameras, first person camera and orthographic cameras for frontal and back view
- **Exploration of lines**. Namely, the use of lines to draw a frame of a car, a folded newspaper, a spring and a vase with a flower in it.

#### Scene description

- A scene with a wooden table and 4 red chairs, a carpet, a clay jar with a sunflower, a workign television and 3 frames (of a dog, cat and a car drawn with lines). On the table is a cake on a plate, a jornal with multiple pages and a spring. There are 4 lights on the corners of the room and one spotlight on top of the cake. Sunlight is streaming into the room through the window.
- Its possible to see the outside of the window moving around, following the camera. A skybox is used to give the parallax illusion of a landscape outside the window.

#### Extra features

- The camera has a **first person view** that can be moved around the scene using the keyboard (WASD + Arrows + SHIFT + Space) .
- Use of a **skybox** to give the illusion of a landscape outside the window
- Use of a **video texture** for the television
- Use of a **normal maps** for floor, wood table top and chair
- Optional **shader** for a more realistic fire in the candle
