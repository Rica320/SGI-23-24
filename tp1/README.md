## Project information

- **Exploration of different types of textures**. Namely, simple textures, video textures and normal maps.
- **Exploration of different types of materials**. For instance, metalic materials for the chair and table support, a wood material for the table top, ceil and floor, a red cloath material for the chair, a clay material for the jar and a glass translucide material for the window.
- **Exploration of different types of lights and shadows**. Namely, spotlights, point lights and directional lights. With lights entering the room from the windows, giving more realism for the scen and shadows being casted in the scene.
