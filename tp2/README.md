## Project information

### Implemented Features
- Scene graph hierarchy organization
- Scene graph material, texture, transformation, shadows inheritance
- Node duplication to resolve scene tree issues in ThreeJS
- Utilization of various materials
- Implementation of LOD (Level of Detail) on two objects (a spaceship with three levels and a statue with two levels)
- Implementation of a Space Skybox displaying stars
- Integration of simple textures
- Implementation of Mip-Map Texture with four different resolutions for a holographic table (including a small mark - for easier assessment)
- Application of Bump Map textures on the metal floor, garage door, and sand floor
- Integration of Video texture on a door's code and on the energy orb on the main statue
- Display of a Wireframe object in a holographic globe projection
- Implementation of Buffer Geometry
- Introduction of a GUI for interaction and scene control
