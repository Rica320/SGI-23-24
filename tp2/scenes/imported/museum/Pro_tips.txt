The ones soaring high above (professors) have finally heeded our calls, and updated the parser. Now the lights are working as we intended them to. 


Also, if the textures are not being displayed, its probably because of the filepath. The ones up above (professors) were so kind so as to not define a standart for this. We have the filepaths as they are in the original demo.xml:

<texture id="baseTex" filepath="textures/Marble014_1K-JPG_Color.jpg"/>

some of y'all have added the whole scenes/<folder>/textures/.... path. 

Again, not saying y'all are wrong. when in doubt, the blame should always go to the ones high above (professors).


Also also, we left a nifty python script in the textures folder that makes textures into videos for the videoTexture texture. Have fun with it.
